  <a name="MLB"> <h1> MLB  </h1></a>

<p>America’s pastime is having its worst year since 1994, when most teams managed to play at least 114 games before a strike left bitter fans without a World Series. This year, the coronavirus pandemic has far surpassed that debacle and is spreading the pain more widely. Owners are losing stadium revenue of $5 billion, and fans are stuck at home singing lonely refrains of “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” while restaurants and vendors who feed off of the venue ecosystem are left starving. </p>

<p>It’s also costing the league’s five highest-paid players a combined $108 million. </p>

<p>After weeks of combative negotiations between the players’ union and owners reached a stalemate last month, Commissioner Rob Manfred made the call: The season would happen, with 60 games instead of 162, all of them to be played without fans by players who would take a 63% cut in base pay.</p>

<p>To be sure, for the highest-paid players in the game, the pain is relative. The top ten players will pull in a collective $152 million this year, down from $315 million last year, mostly the result of the pay cut that was commensurate with the reduced number of games. Now, just two weeks in, Manfred’s plan is already being tested after two teams—the Miami Marlins and the St. Louis Cardinals—reported outbreaks causing a rash of canceled games and leading the boss this week to send out an even stricter list of Covid-19 protocols for teams to follow.</p>

<p>“We are playing,” a defiant Manfred told ESPN last Saturday. “The players need to be better, but I am not a quitter in general, and there is no reason to quit now." </p>

<p>This scenario puts Washington Nationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg in the No. 1 spot on the earnings list for the first time, with $19 million in salary and endorsements. Last year’s top-paid player, Mike Trout, pulled in $39 million.</p>

<br>
<p>The shortened season means signing bonuses, deferred payments and endorsements all play a dramatically larger role than usual in the pecking order of MLB pay. Strasburg signed a seven-year, $245 million contract in December, which set a record for a pitcher that lasted a week until Gerrit Cole surpassed it with a nine-year, $324 million deal to play for the New York Yankees. Cole ranks No. 7 on this year’s earnings list with $14 million since his salary should be a straight $36 million annually without any bonuses, leading to a 63% haircut on his original 2020 pay.</p>

<br>
<p>Strasburg had the right to opt out of the final four years of his contract with the Nationals, which he did in November. That triggered payment of a deferred $30 million he was due on that old deal, which has to be paid out in full over three years, regardless of how many games he plays this year.</p>


<p>He can thank uber-agent Scott Boras, whose clients dominate the list with five of the top eight active players. Boras also has a trio of clients, previously released by their teams, who are due more than $60 million combined—Prince Fielder ($24 million), Jacoby Ellsbury ($21.1 million) and Wei-Yin Chen ($19 million)—and none of it is subject to the 63% cut. None of the three were expected to play at all in 2020 because of injury or poor performance, but players released by their teams with guaranteed contracts are owed 100% of the money, even in a pandemic. Ellsbury’s pay is still subject to a dispute between the union and the Yankees, the world’s second-most valuable sports franchise.</p>

<p>Three of Strasburg’s fellow National League hurlers—Clayton Kershaw, Jon Lester and Max Scherzer—rank among the top five MLB earners thanks to signing bonuses in their existing contracts that call for staggered pay, this year included. </p>


<blockquote> "The bank accounts for MLB players are also getting hit off the field," Forbes </blockquote>

<p>The bank accounts for MLB players are also getting hit off the field. They already lag their peers in football, basketball and soccer in terms of endorsement agreements. Most MLB players only have deals showcasing the glove, cleats or bat they use, and almost all of those deals are slashed for the lower number of games in the 2020 season.</p>

<p>The sport’s newest nine-figure contract signee, Mookie Betts, just missed the cut for this year’s list at $12.5 million, which includes $2.5 million from memorabilia—including trading cards—and from sponsors like Nike’s Jordan Brand, Axe Bat, BodyArmor and Wilson. Betts signed a 12-year, $365 million contract extension with the Los Angeles Dodgers last month, the sport’s second-largest deal after Trout’s 12-year, $426.5 million agreement. Betts gets a $65 million signing bonus paid over 15 years starting in 2021.</p>

<p> Towards the end of the MLB season, the number of cases by state continued to rise significantly. Below is a mapped-out visualization of the cases by state. </p>

<p>With the NBA season still suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, NBA teams reduced player salaries by 25%, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks. The season will be played out in an "NBA Bubble" at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. </p>

<br>
<p>The reduction is part of a temporary pay-cut agreed upon by the league and the players union. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski described it as: "something of an escrow account that would return money to the players should all the remaining regular-season games be played in a resumption of the season. Otherwise, teams would keep a percentage of the money based on the cancellation of games."</p>

<p>In total, teams are cutting $30 million in player salary on Friday, May 15.</p>

<blockquote> "If the NBA has to cancel the season, players will lose an estimated total of $1 billion in salary," Insider </blockquote>

<p>According to Marks, if the NBA has to cut regular season games and go right to the playoffs, the reduction could go as high as 40% of player salary. If the NBA has to cancel the season, players will lose an estimated total of $1 billion in salary.</p>


<p>However, some of the league's highest-paid players will not immediately be affected by the reduction, according to Marks. That group consists of LeBron James, Stephen Curry, John Wall, Blake Griffin, Paul George, and Kevin Durant.</p>

<br>
<p>Those six players have already been paid in full and instead will have an "IOU" per paycheck for the 2020-21 season for each time there is a 25% reduction, according to Marks.</p>

<p>Marks reported that while teams have been instructed how to preserve the funds, they are free to spend them how they want. Marks said teams contacted by ESPN had no plans to spend the money, but some that are short on cash could use the money now.</p>

<p>The move comes as the league faces potentially dire financial circumstances. Commissioner Adam Silver estimated that the league could lose as much as $400 million in lost business from its controversy with China in the beginning of the season. One estimate said the league could lose as much as $1 billion if it can't resume the season from the coronavirus. And Silver recently warned players that fans and gate revenue make up about 40% of the league's revenue each season. The league could lose a sizable amount of money if games are played behind closed doors for the foreseeable future.</p>


<a name="economic impact"><h1> Economic impact on the sports Industry </h1></a>

<p>The global sports market is estimated at US $756 billion annually. With the last decade’s analysis, the trajectory of the global sport market seemed to be going only upwards. </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the coronavirus pandemic has also sent shockwaves to micro and small businesses in sport. Mainly grassroots sport, but also fitness clubs, gyms, retailers, event organizers, marketing agencies, sport equipment producers and renters. Also, small sports clubs and associations are the bedrock of affordable sport activities for most European citizens, but many of these small clubs are now facing bankruptcy.</p>

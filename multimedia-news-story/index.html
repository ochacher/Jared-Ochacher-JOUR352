  <a name="MLB"> <h1> MLB Players' salary changes on and off the field </h1></a>
<p>America’s pastime is having its worst year since 1994, when most teams managed to play at least 114 games before a strike left bitter fans without a World Series. This year, the coronavirus pandemic has far surpassed that debacle and is spreading the pain more widely. Owners are losing stadium revenue of $5 billion, and fans are stuck at home singing lonely refrains of “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” while restaurants and vendors who feed off of the venue ecosystem are left starving. </p>

<p>It’s also costing the league’s five highest-paid players a combined $108 million. </p>

<p>After weeks of combative negotiations between the players’ union and owners reached a stalemate last month, Commissioner Rob Manfred made the call: The season would happen, with 60 games instead of 162, all of them to be played without fans by players who would take a 63% cut in base pay.</p>

<p>To be sure, for the highest-paid players in the game, the pain is relative. The top ten players will pull in a collective $152 million this year, down from $315 million last year, mostly the result of the pay cut that was commensurate with the reduced number of games. Now, just two weeks in, Manfred’s plan is already being tested after two teams—the Miami Marlins and the St. Louis Cardinals—reported outbreaks causing a rash of canceled games and leading the boss this week to send out an even stricter list of Covid-19 protocols for teams to follow.</p>

<p>“We are playing,” a defiant Manfred told ESPN last Saturday. “The players need to be better, but I am not a quitter in general, and there is no reason to quit now." </p>

<p>This scenario puts Washington Nationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg in the No. 1 spot on the earnings list for the first time, with $19 million in salary and endorsements. Last year’s top-paid player, Mike Trout, pulled in $39 million.</p>

<p>The shortened season means signing bonuses, deferred payments and endorsements all play a dramatically larger role than usual in the pecking order of MLB pay. Strasburg signed a seven-year, $245 million contract in December, which set a record for a pitcher that lasted a week until Gerrit Cole surpassed it with a nine-year, $324 million deal to play for the New York Yankees. Cole ranks No. 7 on this year’s earnings list with $14 million since his salary should be a straight $36 million annually without any bonuses, leading to a 63% haircut on his original 2020 pay.</p>

<p>Strasburg had the right to opt out of the final four years of his contract with the Nationals, which he did in November. That triggered payment of a deferred $30 million he was due on that old deal, which has to be paid out in full over three years, regardless of how many games he plays this year.</p>


<p>He can thank uber-agent Scott Boras, whose clients dominate the list with five of the top eight active players. Boras also has a trio of clients, previously released by their teams, who are due more than $60 million combined—Prince Fielder ($24 million), Jacoby Ellsbury ($21.1 million) and Wei-Yin Chen ($19 million)—and none of it is subject to the 63% cut. None of the three were expected to play at all in 2020 because of injury or poor performance, but players released by their teams with guaranteed contracts are owed 100% of the money, even in a pandemic. Ellsbury’s pay is still subject to a dispute between the union and the Yankees, the world’s second-most valuable sports franchise.</p>

<p>Three of Strasburg’s fellow National League hurlers—Clayton Kershaw, Jon Lester and Max Scherzer—rank among the top five MLB earners thanks to signing bonuses in their existing contracts that call for staggered pay, this year included. </p>

<p>The bank accounts for MLB players are also getting hit off the field. They already lag their peers in football, basketball and soccer in terms of endorsement agreements. Most MLB players only have deals showcasing the glove, cleats or bat they use, and almost all of those deals are slashed for the lower number of games in the 2020 season.</p>

<p>The sport’s newest nine-figure contract signee, Mookie Betts, just missed the cut for this year’s list at $12.5 million, which includes $2.5 million from memorabilia—including trading cards—and from sponsors like Nike’s Jordan Brand, Axe Bat, BodyArmor and Wilson. Betts signed a 12-year, $365 million contract extension with the Los Angeles Dodgers last month, the sport’s second-largest deal after Trout’s 12-year, $426.5 million agreement. Betts gets a $65 million signing bonus paid over 15 years starting in 2021.</p>
